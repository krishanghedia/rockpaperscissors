// pseudo-code for rock, paper, scissors DOM game

/*

1. create HTML and CSS styling for the game

2. using OOP or procedural - 

    - wire up 3 icons to the DOM - get the elements by classname, for the references to the DOM

    - add event listeners to the icons, which listen for a click

    - when player the clicks, the computer should randomly pick their choice
        - (i believe the pure JS scipt for this is built)

    - wire up the findWinner function to a score board
        - the scoreboard has the player score and computer score
        - dependant on the winner, increment the score
        - the score should update to the DOM on each turn
    
    - AFTER the above, add local storage to save the scores to disk
